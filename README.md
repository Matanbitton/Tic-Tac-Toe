## About The Project

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I made in order to understand the use of Closure, Factory Functions and the Module Pattern in JavaScript.

I intend to implement a min max algorithm so that the player plays against an impossible to beat A.I soon.

## What I learned:

- What is a Closure in JS.

- How and when to use the Module Pattern.

- The downside of using constructors to initialize objects.

- The benefit of using Factory Functions to initialize objects.

- The importance of NOT pullting the global namespace.


## What I struggled with:

- I struggled to understand which functions belong inside the GameBoard module
  because the GameBoard is a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) it should only be activated once.
  I figured it out at the end, but more reading is necessary on the subject.
